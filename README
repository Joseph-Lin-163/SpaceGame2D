This is my Space game for 2D.
Built on Unity3D.

Many of the functionality works:
1. Scene Transitions
2. Player movement
3. AI, etc.

Add to build settings Main Menu and Week 6
To begin, load Main Menu and use mouse to press play (blue button)
Use wasd to move player ship and space bar to shoot

Some things are not in order:
1. GUIText alignment (this works fine on a 1920x1080 resolution monitor)
2. Buttons for High Score, Options, and Quit
3. Options menu (ESC Key) while in game mode

These will need to be implemented later on down the road.

Special Thanks to Rick Strom for providing a lot of the assets, 
animations, music, etc. I would not have the assets to begin this
project without you, otherwise.
